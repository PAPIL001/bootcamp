# Day 1 Tasks - Markdown Practice

Today, I worked on the following tasks related to Markdown, as provided earlier:

## 1. Markdown Cheatsheet

I started by understanding the different elements of Markdown that are essential for writing a good README. Here are some of the things I learned about:

- **Headings:** Using `#`, `##`, etc., to create different levels of headings.
- **Text Formatting:** Making text **bold** using `**` or `__`, *italic* using `*` or `_`, and ~~strikethrough~~ using `~~`.
- **Lists:** Creating unordered lists with `*`, `-`, or `+`, and ordered lists with numbers.
- **Links:** Adding inline links like `[Visit Google](https://www.google.com)` and understanding reference-style links.
- **Images:** Embedding images using `![Alt text](image_url)`.
- **Code Blocks:** Showing inline code with `` `code` `` and fenced code blocks with ```.
- **Tables:** Creating simple tables with `|` and `-`.
- **Horizontal Rules:** Using `***`, `---`, or `___` to create thematic breaks.

I plan to use this knowledge to create a comprehensive Markdown cheatsheet later.

## 2. README Authoring

I also thought about the structure of a good README file. It should include:

- **Purpose:** What the project is and its goals.
- **Installation Steps:** How to get the project running.
- **Usage Examples:** How to use the main features.
- **Troubleshooting:** Common issues and solutions.

I might try to draft a README for a simple hypothetical project in the future, applying the Markdown skills I'm learning today.

## 3. Daily Log

This `my_notes.md` file itself can serve as part of my daily log for today, focusing on what I learned about creating folders and files via the terminal and practicing basic Markdown.

### What I learned today:

- How to create a new directory using the `mkdir` command in the terminal.
- How to navigate into a directory using the `cd` command.
- How to create a basic text file (which I'm now editing as a Markdown file) using `nano`.
- The fundamental syntax for various Markdown elements.

### What confused me today:

- Initially, I had a bit of trouble navigating into the `day 1` folder due to a misunderstanding of my current location in the terminal.
- The purpose and usage of the `.swp` file created by `nano` was a bit unclear at first.

I will continue to practice these concepts and build upon them in the coming days.
