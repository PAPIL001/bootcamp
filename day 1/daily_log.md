### What I learned

* Today, I completed a detailed Markdown cheatsheet covering various elements and providing examples. This will be a useful reference for writing READMEs and other Markdown documents.
* I also created a very simple Python project ("Simple Greeter") and wrote a complete README file for it, including purpose, installation steps, usage examples, and basic troubleshooting. This helped me apply the Markdown knowledge in a practical context.
* I continued to practice using the terminal to create files and navigate directories within my VM.

### What confused me

* Initially, I needed to ensure I was structuring the Markdown cheatsheet logically and providing clear, concise explanations for each element.
* When writing the README, I considered the appropriate level of detail for the installation and usage instructions for a beginner.
