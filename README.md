# Server Coding Bootcamp Overview

This document provides an overview of the Server Coding Bootcamp, outlining its objectives, expectations, structure, and evaluation criteria.

## Introduction to Application Development

This bootcamp is designed for participants already familiar with programming, Python, and Linux. It serves two primary purposes:

* **Reinforcing Best Practices:** Mastering tools, processes, and code quality.
* **Industry Suitability Evaluation:** Assessing participants' readiness for real-world software development.

## What This Bootcamp Is Not

* **No Pre-Packaged Training Material:** Participants are free to choose their own learning resources.
* **No Traditional Instruction:** Instructors facilitate work and provide feedback, rather than delivering structured lessons.

## Expectations from Participants

* **Commitment & Process Adherence:** Diligently follow instructions and complete tasks.
* **Perseverance in Problem-Solving:** Attempt all drills and strive for completion.
* **Code Quality & Empathy:** Prioritize writing clean, maintainable code.
* **Self-Learning & Internalization:** Understand and apply assigned reading.

The drills aim to solidify fundamentals. Participants are encouraged to use AI tools like ChatGPT or Claude.ai to explore solutions and applications, but not for completing the drills themselves.

## Usage of LLMs

LLMs are valuable for learning concepts and for problem-solving (the "game"), but not for the drills (the "exercises").  The bootcamp emphasizes hands-on practice to build fundamental skills.

## Structure of the Bootcamp

### Communication & Collaboration

* **Joining Slack:** Participants are expected to join the designated Slack workspace and relevant channels.
* **Introductory Message:** Participants will post an introductory message on Slack, including:
    * A brief introduction (background, goals for the bootcamp).
    * Confirmation that pre-join setup steps are complete.
    * Details of any setup difficulties encountered.
* **Ways of Working:**
    * **Assignment Status Reports:** Participants will report on their daily progress, completed tasks, challenges faced, and pending items.
    * **Code Check-in:** Participants will check their code into a specified GitHub monorepo, ensuring each project has a `README.md` with a task description, solution description, and link to any LLM usage.
