Docker DeploymentThis system can be deployed using Docker, which simplifies the setup and management of the application and its dependencies.PrerequisitesDocker installed on your system.  See the official Docker documentation for installation instructions:Docker Desktop for WindowsDocker Desktop for macOSDocker Engine for LinuxBasic understanding of Docker concepts (images, containers, etc.).StepsClone the repository (if you haven't already):git clone <repository_url>
cd figure_caption_extractor
Build the Docker image:The Dockerfile in the repository root defines how to build the Docker image for the application.From the project root directory, run the following command:docker build -t figure_caption_extractor .
-t figure_caption_extractor:  This tags the image with the name figure_caption_extractor.  You can choose a different name if you prefer..:  This specifies that the Dockerfile is located in the current directory.Docker will download the necessary base image, install dependencies, and package the application code into a Docker image.  This process may take some time.Run the Docker container:Once the image is built, you can run a container from it using the following command:docker run -p 8000:8000 figure_caption_extractor
-p 8000:8000: This maps port 8000 on your host machine to port 8000 in the container.  The application runs on port 8000 inside the container, so this makes it accessible from your host.  If you need to use a different port on your host, change the first 8000.  The second 8000 (after the colon) should generally remain 8000 unless you've changed the port the application listens on.figure_caption_extractor:  This specifies the name of the image to run.  Use the same name you used in the docker build step.This command will start the application in a Docker container. The API will be accessible at http://localhost:8000 (or the port you specified).Docker Compose (Optional)For more complex deployments, you can use Docker Compose to define and manage multi-container applications.  A docker-compose.yaml file is often included in the repository.If a docker-compose.yaml file is available, you can deploy the application with a single command:docker-compose up -d
-d:  Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).Make sure that the database configuration in config/config.yaml is consistent with your docker-compose setup. If you are using a database container, the host should be the name of the service defined in docker-compose.yaml.ConfigurationEnvironment Variables: When using Docker, it's often best to configure the application using environment variables.  You can pass environment variables to the container using the -e flag with docker run or the environment section in docker-compose.yaml.For example, to set the API key, you could use:docker run -p 8000:8000 -e API_KEY=your_secure_api_key figure_caption_extractor
And then change your config/config.yaml to read the API key from the environment api:
    key: ${API_KEY}
Important: Do not hardcode sensitive information like API keys in your Dockerfile.  Use environment variables or Docker secrets.Persistent DataBy default, any data stored in the container's file system will be lost when the container is stopped or removed.If you need to persist the data (e.g., the SQLite database), you should use a Docker volume.Example using docker run:docker run -p 8000:8000 -v figure_caption_data:/app/paper_data figure_caption_extractor
-v figure_caption_data:/app/paper_data:  This creates a volume named figure_caption_data and mounts it to the /app/paper_data directory in the container (where the database is stored, assuming your config.yaml  has  path: "/app/paper_data/paper_data.db").With Docker Compose, you would define a volume in the docker-compose.yaml file.Accessing the APIOnce the container is running, the API will be accessible at:http://localhost:8000 (if running on your local machine)http://<server_ip>:8000 (if running on a remote server), replacing <server_ip> with the actual IP address of your server.You can then use the API endpoints as described in the API Usage section of the main README.
